# Contributing to Skyblock

Welcome to the guide of contributing to Skyblock! Below are the **rules of contributing to Skyblock**.

# Bugs

**This project is under heavy development**, and it is you who will discover bugs and make the project better. Here are the things you should do if you find a bug.

First, **calm yourself**. Your computer isn't crashing or getting hacked. It's probably just a bug caused by my unawareness when coding something. But if you do as below, I'll get to know the bug.

Next, **post a screenshot or copy the text about how the error happened**. You should include some of your actions, so I can find the bugs easier. **Be careful to sensor your personal information because it's easy you leak your information and get yourself in danger with screenshots.** If you feel like it's needed, please also address your Operating System, Python version, and saved files.

Last, wait for responses. If you've gone to this step, then congratulations, you just made your contribution! Contributions will improve the experience of you and others and prevent the bug from becoming worse.

# Testing for Bugs

It would be really helpful if you report any bug you encounter, including any unexpected behaviour, weird errors and exits, item glitches, and etc. I encourage you to try to crash or break this game (by playing), so that you may find rare bugs, and I'll be able to furthur optimize the code and make this project better.

# Feature Ideas or Modification Suggestions

If you have ideas about adding or improving features, address issues about them. **I'll determine if your suggestions are helpful for the project or not.** Helpful ideas will typically apply to the following rules:
* trying to recreate the original Hypixel Skyblock;
* containing the main idea and preferably, specific solutions;
* doable and fitting CLI.

If a suggestion is considered helpful and specific solutions are available, the suggestion will be taken.
